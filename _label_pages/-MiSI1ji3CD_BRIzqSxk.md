firstAidPhysician:
  ENG: "Note to Physician: Aluminum phosphide in WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets reacts with\
    \ moisture from the air, water, acids and many other liquids to release hydrogen\
    \ phosphide (phosphine) gas. Mild exposure by inhalation causes malaise (indefinite\
    \ feeling of sickness), ringing of ears, fatigue, nausea, and pressure in the\
    \ chest, which is relieved by removal to fresh air. Moderate poisoning causes\
    \ weakness, vomiting, pain just above the stomach, chest pain, diarrhea and dyspnea\
    \ (difficulty in breathing). Symptoms of severe poisoning may occur within a few\
    \ hours to several days, resulting in pulmonary edema (fluid in lungs) and may\
    \ lead to dizziness, cyanosis (blue or purple skin color), unconsciousness, and\
    \ death. In suf- ficient quantity, phosphine affects the liver, kidneys, lungs,\
    \ nervous system and circulatory system. Inhalation can cause lung edema (fluid\
    \ in lungs) and hyperemia (excess of blood in a body part), small perivascular\
    \ brain hemorrhage and brain edema (fluid in brain). Ingestion can cause lung\
    \ and brain symptoms but damage to the viscera (body cavity organs) is more common.\
    \ Phosphine poisoning may result in (1) pulmonary edema, (2) liver elevated serum\
    \ GOT, LDH and alkaline phosphatase, reduced prothrombin, hemorrhage and jaundice\
    \ (yellow skin color) and (3) kidney hematuria (blood in urine) and anauria (abnormal\
    \ lack of urination). Pathology is characterized by hypoxia (oxygen deficiency\
    \ in blood tissue). Frequent exposure to subacute concentrations over a period\
    \ of days or weeks may cause poisoning. Treatment is symptomatic.\n\n"

    \ and partially spent dust will release phosphine gas if exposed to moisture from\
    \ the air or if it comes into contact with water, acids and many other liquids.\
    \ Piling of tablets or dust from their fragmentation may cause a temperature increase\
    \ and confine the release of gas so that ignition could occur. It is recommended\
    \ that opening of aluminum phosphide products be performed in open air or near\
    \ a fan which exhausts outside immediately. Never open in a flammable atmosphere\
    \ because on rare occasions a flash may occur. When opening, invert the container\
    \ several times and then point the container away from the face and body and slowly\
    \ loosen the cap. Since phosphine may ignite spontaneously at levels above its\
    \ lower flammable limit of 1.8% v/v, it is important not to exceed this concentration.\
    \ Ignition of high concentrations of phosphine can produce a very energetic reaction.\
    \ Explosions can occur under these conditions and may cause severe personal injury.\
    \ Never allow the buildup of phosphine to exceed explosive concentrations. Do\
    \ not confine spent or partially spent metal phosphide fumigants as the slow release\
    \ of phosphine from this material may result in formation of an explosive atmosphere.\
    \ Aluminum phosphide WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets outside the containers should not\
    \ be stacked or piled up or contacted with liquid water. This may cause a temperature\
    \ increase, increase the rate of gas production and confine the gas so that ignition\
    \ could occur. These precautions will also reduce the fumigator\u2019s exposure\
    \ to phosphine gas. Pure phosphine gas is practically insoluble in water, fats\
    \ and oils, and is stable at normal fumigation temperatures. However, it may react\
    \ with certain metals and cause corrosion, especially at higher temperatures and\
    \ relative humidities. Metals such as copper, brass and other copper alloys, and\
    \ precious metals such as gold and silver are susceptible to corrosion by phosphine.\
    \ Thus, small electric motors, smoke detectors, brass sprinkler heads, batteries\
    \ and battery chargers, fork lifts, temperature monitoring systems, switching\
    \ gears, communication devices, computers, calculators and other electrical equipment\
    \ should be protected or removed before fumigation. Phosphine will also react\
    \ with certain metallic salts and, therefore, sensitive items such as photographic\
    \ film, some inorganic pigments, etc., should not be exposed.\n"

storageDisposal:
  ENG: "Storage Instructions \n1. Store WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets in a dry, well ventilated\
    \ area away from heat, under lock and key. Post as a pesticide storage area. \n\
    2. Do not store in buildings where humans or domestic animals reside. Keep out\
    \ of reach of children. \n3. WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets are supplied in gas-tight,\
    \ resealable aluminum flasks. Do not expose the product to atmospheric moisture\
    \ any longer than is necessary and seal tightly before returning flasks to storage.\n\
    \nPesticide Disposal \nDo not contaminate water, food or feed by storage or disposal.\
    \ \nUnreacted or partially reacted WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE is acutely hazardous. Improper\
    \ disposal of excess pesticide is a violation of Federal Law. If these wastes\
    \ cannot be disposed of by use according to label instructions, contact your State\
    \ Pesticide or Environmental Control Agency, or the Hazardous Waste representative\
    \ at the nearest EPA Regional Office for guidance. For specific instructions,\
    \ see Disposal Instructions and Spill and Leak Procedures in the Applicator\u2019\
    s Manual. Some local and state waste disposal regulations may vary therefore disposal\
    \ procedures must be reviewed with appropriate authorities to ensure compliance\
    \ with these regulations. Contact your state Pesticide or Environmental Control\
    \ Agency or Hazardous Waste Specialist at the nearest EPA Regional Office for\
    \ guidance.\n\nContainer Disposal\nNon-refillable container. Do not reuse or refill\
    \ this container. Offer for recycling. Triple rinse container (or\nequivalent)\
    \ promptly after emptying. \nTriple rinse flasks and stoppers with water as follows:\
    \ \nEmpty the remaining contents into application equipment or a mix tank. Fill\
    \ the container 1/4 full with water and recap. Shake for 10 seconds. Pour rinsate\
    \ into application equipment or a mix tank or store rinsate for later use or disposal.\
    \ Drain for 10 seconds after the flow begins to drip. Repeat this procedure two\
    \ more times. Then offer for recycling, if available or offer for reconditioning,\
    \ if appropriate, or puncture and dispose of in a sanitary landfill, or by other\
    \ procedures approved by state and local authorities. Rinsate may be disposed\
    \ of in a sanitary landfill, by pouring it out onto the ground or by other approved\
    \ procedures. It is permissible to remove lids and expose empty flasks to atmospheric\
    \ conditions until residue in the flask is reacted. Then puncture and dispose\
    \ of in a sanitary landfill or other approved site, or by other procedures approved\
    \ by state and local authorities. If properly exposed the residual dust remaining\
    \ after a fumigation with WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets will be a grayishwhite powder\
    \ and contain only a small amount of unreacted aluminum phosphide. However, residual\
    \ dust from incompletely exposed WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets may require special care.\
    \ \n\nSpill and Leak Procedures \nGeneral Precautions and Directions\nA spill,\
    \ other than incidental to application or normal handling, may produce high levels\
    \ of gas and, therefore, attending personnel must wear SCBA or its equivalent\
    \ when the concentration of hydrogen phosphide gas is unknown. Other NIOSH/MSHA\
    \ approved respiratory protection may be worn if the concentration is known. Do\
    \ not use water at any time to clean up a spill of WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets. Water\
    \ in contact with unreacted WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets will greatly accelerate the\
    \ production of hydrogen phosphide gas which could result in a toxic and/or fire\
    \ hazard. Wear gloves of cotton or other material when handling aluminum phosphide.\n\
    Return all intact aluminum flasks to cardboard case or other suitable packaging\
    \ which has been properly marked according to DOT regulations.\nNotify consignee\
    \ and shipper of damaged cases.\nIf aluminum flasks have been punctured or damaged\
    \ so as to leak, the container may be temporarily repaired with aluminum tape\
    \ or the WEEVIL-CIDE\xAE Tablets may be transferred from the damaged flask to\
    \ a sound metal container which should be sealed and properly labeled as aluminum\
    \ phosphide. Transport the damaged containers to an area suitable for pesticide\
    \ storage for inspection. Refer to the Applicator\u2019s Manual for more detailed\
    \ Spill and Leak procedures."
